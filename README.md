# Productimon

This monorepo contains all code and documentation for Productimon, a cross-platform activity/usage/screen time tracking and analytics tool. It currently supports Linux, Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS/Chromium OS, with a cross-platform core codebase that's easy to extend to other platforms.

## Architecture

Productimon is composed of 4 modules:

- [**DataAggregator**](aggregator), key component to connect everything together, serves as RPC server and store all data;
- [**DataAnalyzer**](analyzer), analytical pipeline to predict app label and transform raw event stream to interval index (bundled in DataAggregator);
- [**DataReporter**](reporter), cross-platform native app as well as browser extension to report activities to designated server;
- [**DataViewer**](viewer), front-end to view activity analytics and metrics (bundled in DataAggregator).

## Installing

We are releasing a set of compiled binaries on GitHub for your convenience.

On Windows: unzip our binary release [productimon-reporter-windows-x86_64.zip](https://github.com/productimon/productimon/releases/download/v0.1/productimon-reporter-windows-x86_64.zip) and run reporter.exe within the unzipped folder

On Linux: install the deb package [productimon-reporter-linux-x86_64.deb](https://github.com/productimon/productimon/releases/download/v0.1/productimon-reporter-linux-x86_64.deb) and run productimon-reporter in your terminal. Alternatively, download the executable [productimon-reporter-linux-x86_64](https://github.com/productimon/productimon/releases/download/v0.1/productimon-reporter-linux-x86_64) and run it directly. NOTE you might need to install runtime dependencies before running the program, see details in [reporter/README.md](reporter/README.md)

On macOS: unzip our binary release [productimon-reporter-darwin-x86_64.zip](https://github.com/productimon/productimon/releases/download/v0.1/productimon-reporter-darwin-x86_64.zip) and install the unzipped app to /Applications after which you can find it and run it in LaunchPad.

On Google Chrome: unzip the release [productimon-reporter-chrome_extension.zip](https://github.com/productimon/productimon/releases/download/v0.1/productimon-reporter-chrome_extension.zip) and navigate to chrome://extensions/, enable developer mode in the top right corner and click load unpacked button to select the unzipped extension folder to install it.


We are hosting a public DataAggregator instance at [my.productimon.com](https://my.productimon.com), but
you can also deploy your own server to fully customize it and keep your data in your own hands.

## Building

Check the README.md file under each directory to check more details and required dev/runtime dependencies.

DataAggregator, DataAnalyzer, and DataViewer are bundled into a single binary:

```
bazel build //aggregator
```

For DataReporter,
```
bazel build //reporter/cli
bazel build //reporter/gui
bazel build //reporter/gui:gui-windows
bazel build //reporter/gui:gui-linux-deb
bazel build //reporter/browser:chrome_extension
```

Insert `-c dbg` after `bazel build` to get a debug build.

## Development

### Source Code

We use our internal Gerrit instance for code review as the canonical repo. We also host a
[public GitHub mirror for open-sourcing](https://github.com/productimon/productimon)


### Coding Style

- Use `buildifier` for Bazel BUILD files.
- Use `clang-format` for c/c++/proto files.
- Use `gofmt` for Golang files.
- Use `prettier` for HTML/CSS/JS/Markdown files.

### Design Docs

- [System Architecture Diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1TWAxg70vu_xM8AbtSZTbwLAWlQPJRRmYKtxeFkw_HkI)
- [API Documentation](/proto)


### Dev Env Setup

- [Windows Setup](docs/windows.md)
